# ASUS ROG Bloatware Service Removal Tool
Simple script with options to remove useless ASUS services. Preparation for 3rd party replacements of Armoury Crate and MyASUS.


Hello! I have made simple script to remove ASUS services, because they are installed after each driver update. It may also help people who want to switch to 3rd party tools like G-Helper (https://github.com/seerge/g-helper).
Added script to configure and start Asus OSD without MyASUS application.
